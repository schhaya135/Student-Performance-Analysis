# Student-Performance-Analysis
My objective here was to get actionable insights to recognition to other factors and understand their influence and inform educational institutions in optimising support systems for student overall success.

Methodology/Flowchart :

1.I gathered dataset  from Kaggle that consists of the marks secured by 1000 students in 3 different subjects along with their ethnicity, gender, parents education,lunches provided to them,their attempt at test preparation courses.

2.EDA was performed. Where missing values, duplicates , their data types, overall descriptive statistics were dealt with. Further ahead univariate bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted.Correlation between different categorical variables were explored.Visualisation tools like histograms, lineplots, scatterpplots helped us to extract certain conclusion based on average score distribution

   a.standard lunch helped students to perform well in exam irrespective of the genders they belonged to
   
   b.In general parent's education don't help student perform well in exam, however parent's whose education is of associate's degree or master's degree their male child tend to perform well in exam and there is no 
   effect of parent's education on female students.
   
   c.On an average females have a better overall score than men, whereas males have scored higher in Maths.
   
   d.Students from a lower Socioeconomic status have a lower avg in all course subjects
   
   e.Students who get Standard Lunch tend to perform better than students who got free/reduced lunch
   
   f.Students who have completed the Test Preparation Course have scores higher in all three categories than those who haven't taken the course
